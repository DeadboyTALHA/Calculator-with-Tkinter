## üöÄ Overview

This project is a fully functional graphical calculator that mimics the core functionality of a standard calculator. It's built entirely in Python using the built-in Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, demonstrating key concepts of event-driven programming, widget management, and layout design.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`).
- **Clear Functionality**: A dedicated `C` button to reset the calculation.
- **Equals Operation**: The `=` button evaluates the expression and displays the result.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
    - A clean, modern dark theme.
    - Large, easy-to-read display.
    - Responsive buttons with visual feedback.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles common errors like division by zero.

## üíª Installation

To run this calculator on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6 or higher** must be installed on your system.
- You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DeadboyTALHA/Calculator-with-Tkinter.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Calculator-with-Tkinter
    ```
3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python Talha's Calculator.py
    ```
    *If the above command doesn't work, try `python3 Talha's Calculator.py`.*

## üéÆ Usage

1.  Launch the application by running `Talha's Calculator.py`.
2.  Use your mouse to click on the number buttons (`0-9`) to input digits.
3.  Select an operation button (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
4.  Continue entering the second number.
5.  Press the `=` button to see the result of the calculation.
6.  Press the `C` button at any time to clear the display and start a new calculation.

## üîç Code Overview

### Main Components (`calculator.py`)

The application is structured within a single Python script:

- **`Calculator` Class**: The main class that initializes the GUI and handles the application logic.
- **GUI Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    - Creates the main application window (`Tk`).
    - Sets up the title, geometry, and resizability.
    - Configures a modern dark theme for all widgets.
- **Widget Creation**:
    - **Display**: An `Entry` widget used as a read-only display for numbers and results.
    - **Button Frame**: A `Frame` to hold all the calculator buttons.
    - **Buttons**: Dynamically created buttons for digits, operators, and actions, arranged in a grid layout.
- **Core Methods**:
    - `button_click(number)`: Appends clicked numbers and operators to the current expression in the display.
    - `button_clear()`: Clears the display field.
    - `button_equal()`: Evaluates the mathematical expression in the display using `eval()` and shows the result or an error message.

### Key Logic
- The current expression is built as a string in the `Entry` widget.
- The `eval()` function is used to compute the result when the `=` button is pressed, which is a simple and effective approach for this scope of project.
- Basic error handling catches exceptions (like division by zero) and displays "Error".

## üì¶ Dependencies
